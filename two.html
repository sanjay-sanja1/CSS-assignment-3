  <!-- Explanation of Absolute Positioning -->
  <div>
    <p>
      Absolute positioning is used to place an element relative to its nearest positioned ancestor,
      which could be any ancestor with a position property other than static (e.g., relative, absolute, or fixed).
      If no such ancestor is found, the element is positioned relative to the initial containing block,
      which is usually the viewport.

  </div>

  <!-- Explanation of Relative Positioning -->
  <div>
    <p>
      Relative positioning is used to place an element relative to its normal position.
      The element still occupies the space it would have taken up in the normal flow,
      and then it's offset from that position based on the values of the top, right, bottom, or left properties.
      Importantly, it doesn't affect the positioning of other elements; they act as if the element is still in its normal position.
